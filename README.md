A CLI for writing documents in Markdown while collaborating with Word users.

You write in Markdown under version control. Your collaborators use Word (or PDF). docrev converts between the two, preserving track changes, comments, equations, and cross-references.

## The Problem

You've been here before:

```
manuscript_v1.docx
manuscript_v2_john_comments.docx
manuscript_v2_jane_comments.docx
manuscript_v3_merged_final.docx
manuscript_v3_merged_final_REAL.docx
manuscript_v3_merged_final_REAL_submitted.docx
```

Three reviewers send back three Word files. You manually compare changes, copy-paste between documents, lose track of who said what. A week later, you can't remember which version has the figure updates.

**docrev fixes this.** You write in plain text. Reviewers use Word. Their feedback flows back into your files automatically. One source of truth, full version history, no more file chaos.

## Highlights

- **Markdown → Word/PDF** with citations, figures, equations, cross-references
- **Round-trip sync**: import Word track changes and comments back to Markdown
- **CLI review workflow**: reply to comments, accept/reject changes from terminal
- **DOI tools**: validate, lookup, and auto-add references from DOIs
- **21 journal styles**: Nature, Science, PNAS, and more
- **Version control friendly**: plain text source, full git history

## Install

```bash
npm install -g docrev
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+, [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) 2.11+, and [LaTeX](#installing-dependencies) for PDF output.

## Quick Example

Write in Markdown with citations and cross-references:

```markdown
Climate change poses significant challenges [@IPCC2021]. As shown in
@fig:temperature, global temperatures have risen steadily.

![Temperature anomalies](figures/temperature.png){#fig:temperature}

The relationship follows $\Delta T = \lambda \cdot \Delta F$ (@eq:forcing).
```

Build and share:

```bash
rev build docx    # → paper.docx (for collaborators)
rev build pdf     # → paper.pdf  (for journals)
```

When collaborators return the Word doc with track changes:

```bash
rev sync reviewed.docx    # their comments → your markdown
```

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐     rev build docx      ┌─────────────┐
│             │ ───────────────────────→│             │
│  Markdown   │                         │    Word     │  → collaborators
│   (you)     │     rev build pdf       │   / PDF     │  → journals
│             │ ───────────────────────→│             │
└─────────────┘                         └─────────────┘
       ↑                                       │
       │              rev sync                 │
       └───────────────────────────────────────┘
              their feedback → your files
```

You stay in Markdown. Collaborators use Word. Journals get PDF. Everyone works in their preferred format.

## The CLI Review Cycle

When reviewers send back a Word document with track changes and comments:

```bash
rev sync reviewed.docx            # import feedback into markdown
```

Track changes appear inline - accept or reject by editing:

```markdown
The sample size was {--100--}{++150++} participants.
```

Handle comments without opening Word:

```bash
rev comments                      # list all comments
rev reply methods.md -n 1 -m "Added clarification"
rev resolve methods.md -n 1       # mark as resolved
rev build docx --dual             # clean + annotated versions
```

Reviewers who annotate PDFs instead of Word? That works too:

```bash
rev sync annotated.pdf            # extract PDF comments
rev pdf-comments annotated.pdf --append methods.md
```

Multiple reviewers sending back separate files? Merge them:

```bash
rev merge reviewer_A.docx reviewer_B.docx   # three-way merge
```

The merge command uses the original document (auto-saved in `.rev/base.docx` on build) to detect what each reviewer changed, identifies conflicts when reviewers edit the same text differently, and lets you resolve them interactively.

Your entire revision cycle stays in the terminal. `final_v3_REAL_final.docx` is over.

## Getting Started

### Starting a New Document

Create a new project:

```bash
rev new my-report
cd my-report
```

You'll be prompted to enter your section names, or press Enter to use the default structure. You can also specify sections directly:

```bash
rev new my-report -s intro,methods,results,discussion
```

Or set your preferred default sections once:

```bash
rev config sections "intro,methods,results,discussion"
```

This creates a folder with your chosen sections:

```
my-report/
├── intro.md
├── methods.md
├── results.md
├── discussion.md
├── references.bib
└── rev.yaml
```

Write your content in the markdown files. When ready to share:

```bash
rev build docx pdf
```

After building, your project structure looks like:

```
my-report/
├── intro.md
├── methods.md
├── results.md
├── discussion.md
├── references.bib
├── rev.yaml
├── paper.md              ← combined sections (auto-generated)
├── my-report.docx        ← output for collaborators
└── my-report.pdf         ← output for journals
```

The output filename is derived from your project title in `rev.yaml`. Citations are resolved, equations rendered, and cross-references numbered.

### Starting from an Existing Word Document

If you have a Word document to convert:

```bash
rev import manuscript.docx
```

This creates a project folder and splits the document into section files. Images are extracted to `figures/`, equations are converted to LaTeX, and track changes/comments are preserved as markdown annotations.

### Configuration

Layout is controlled in `rev.yaml`:

```yaml
title: "My Document"
output:
  docx:
    reference-doc: template.docx   # your Word template
  pdf:
    documentclass: article
    fontsize: 12pt
```

Configure your name for comment replies:

```bash
rev config user "Your Name"
```

## Annotation Syntax

Track changes from Word appear as [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/):

```markdown
The sample size was {--100--}{++150++} participants.   # deletion + insertion
Data was collected {~~monthly~>weekly~~}.              # substitution
{>>Reviewer 2: Please clarify.<<}                      # comment
```

## Writing Tips

Track word count changes between versions:

```bash
rev diff                    # compare against last commit
#  methods.md     +142 words  -38 words
#  results.md      +89 words  -12 words
```

Add references to `references.bib` (BibTeX format):

```bibtex
@article{Smith2020,
  author = {Smith, Jane},
  title = {Paper Title},
  journal = {Nature},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1038/example}
}
```

Cite with `[@Smith2020]` or `[@Smith2020; @Jones2021]` for multiple sources.

Equations use LaTeX: inline `$E = mc^2$` or display `$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$$`.

Cross-references: `@fig:label`, `@tbl:label`, `@eq:label` → "Figure 1", "Table 2", "Equation 3".
