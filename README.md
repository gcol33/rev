**Write papers in plain text. Generate Word when needed.**

## Why

Word documents corrupt. Versions multiply. Track changes become unreadable. Equations break. Figures embed at wrong resolutions.

docrev solves this: write in Markdown, generate Word/PDF for collaborators. They use Word normally. You get version control, clean diffs, and automated formatting.

```
Markdown files  -->  docrev  -->  Word/PDF
      ^                              |
      |                              v
      +---- docrev <---- reviewer feedback
```

## Install

```bash
npm install -g docrev
brew install pandoc
```

## Start a Project

From scratch:
```bash
rev new my-paper
cd my-paper
```

From existing Word document:
```bash
rev import manuscript.docx
```

Project structure:
```
my-paper/
├── introduction.md
├── methods.md
├── results.md
├── discussion.md
├── references.bib
└── rev.yaml
```

## Markdown Basics

```markdown
# Heading

Paragraph text. **Bold** and *italic*.

- Bullet point
- Another point

1. Numbered item
2. Second item
```

### Citations

references.bib:
```bibtex
@article{Smith2020,
  author = {Smith, Jane},
  title = {Paper Title},
  journal = {Nature},
  year = {2020}
}
```

In text:
```markdown
Previous studies [@Smith2020] demonstrated this.
```

Output: "Previous studies (Smith 2020) demonstrated this."

### Equations

Inline: `$E = mc^2$`

Display:
```markdown
$$
\hat{p} = \frac{\sum_d w_d p_d}{\sum_d w_d}
$$
```

### Figures

```markdown
![Study site locations](figures/map.png){#fig:map}

Results shown in @fig:map indicate regional variation.
```

Output: "Results shown in Figure 1 indicate regional variation."

Figure numbers update automatically when reordered.

## Build

```bash
rev build docx          # Word document
rev build pdf           # PDF
rev build --dual        # Clean + comments versions
rev watch docx          # Auto-rebuild on save
```

## Handle Reviewer Feedback

Import reviewed document:
```bash
rev sections reviewed.docx
```

View comments:
```bash
rev comments methods.md
```

Reply to comment:
```bash
rev config user "Your Name"
rev reply methods.md -n 1 -m "Clarified sampling methodology"
```

Rebuild with threaded comments:
```bash
rev build --dual
```

Output:
- `paper.docx` (clean)
- `paper_comments.docx` (with comment threads)
